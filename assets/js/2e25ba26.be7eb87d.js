Administrative functions such as producing form letters could be done much more efficiently with a great reduction in costs by using an AI writer. Technical writing such as producing manuals could similarly benefit from AI writers, especially when used in conjunction with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to perform the required information lookups through the appropriate knowledgebases (Lewis et al., 2020).
