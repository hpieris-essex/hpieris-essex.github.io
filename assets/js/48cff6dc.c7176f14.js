The first, a group assignment, focused on developing a project report, which includes the system requirements, design decisions, and system illustrations. The second is an individual assignment, focused on implementing the system using Python.

The system implementation included features such as agent initialization, task assignment, concurrency control, file processing, and quarantining. Multi-agent systems such as the one we implemented are susceptible to race conditions, which occur when access to shared memory by parallel programs is not properly synchronized (Netzer & Miller, 1992).

Successfully overcoming these hurdles instilled a sense of accomplishment and boosted my confidence in handling complex projects. The initial excitement and motivation drove me to invest extra effort in the early stages, ensuring a solid foundation for the project.
