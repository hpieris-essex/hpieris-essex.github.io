I also appreciated the strong emphasis on why not to shortcut the EDA process. Due to time pressures around projects, I\u2019ve had instances where we moved forward with shallow EDA, only regret it later."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Corelation and regression unit provided me with another opportunity to revisit the fundamentals. We visited topics such as Pearson correlation, linear regression and polynomial regression in this unit. I have used linear regression in the early days of my machine learning career. It was enjoyable to revisit these topics. This is another area where I saw an opportunity to create project checklists and workflows based on the learnings. For example, I imagine having a repeatable decision tree where we ask questions like what is the objective (predict vs measure strength/ direction of a relationship), are both variables on an equal standing, is causation a consideration. And based on the answers having a clear prescriptive checklist we can follow from there. I\u2019m excited to use this learning to optimize my project workflows in the future."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Linear regression with Scikit-Learn provided the opportunity to re-vist this popular library and freshen-up my understanding.

Coming back to Scikit-Learn and reviewing fundamentals such as Linear Regression helped me fully appreciate the importance of these building blocks in more advanced machine learning models."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"During the clustering unit we explored, how the unsupervised learning approach of clustering is used to identify various groups within data. A vast amount of unlabeled data is readily available (Nigam et al., 2000); these could only be used in unsupervised implementations unless someone goes through the effort of labeling. For this reason, unsupervised learning algorithms are an important tool in the machine learning toolbox. This unit provided a foundational understanding of K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised clustering technique. I\u2019m excited to apply these clustering techniques with everyday data such as systems logs and telemetry data to discover patterns."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Clustering with Python unit is when our first group project was due. For the group project, I came up with the business question, produced the first version of the exploratory data analysis Colab notebook, and wrote the introduction and conclusion sections of the report. The other team members iterated on the EDA. I was glad to see another team member introducing the elbow method to validate the number of clusters. We had a last minute communications breakdown. But, we were able to recover quickly and submit the project in time. I think overall we worked well as a team. Some of the communications challenges made me appreciate the cultural and background differences among team members in a distributed setting and the importance of leaving room for the team members to both work jointly and separately to advance the project."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The introduction to ANNs unit provided an overview of how biological neurons function, and how this understanding is modeled in artificial neural networks through weights, biases and layers (Yang et al., 2014).
