At a high level, the system relies on worker agents selecting a file from a list defined by the leader (i.e., the agent can identify and retrieve data), checking whether it could contain sensitive information (i.e., the data is processed) if so, quarantining the file (i.e., the processed information is stored), and then repeating the process until all target files are processed. The system can be activated using the command line where the user specifies the number of worker agents they require. This makes the system adaptable and scalable to the user\u2019s resources and needs. The below high-level diagram provides an overview of this process."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"We made three key design decisions in coming up with the proposed system design: using multiple agents to improve runtime performance, using leader/ worker architecture to introduce worker agent resilience, and using a queue-based approach for efficient task assignment to each agent."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Multiple Agents for Improved Runtime Performance: Deploying multiple agents in the system allows parallel processing, which enables several processors to cooperate in solving a problem, reducing the compute time (Roosta, 2000); this results in the reduction of overall scanning time."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Leader/Worker Architecture for Agent Resilience: Implementing a leader/worker architecture contributes to system resilience by providing a fault-tolerant framework.
