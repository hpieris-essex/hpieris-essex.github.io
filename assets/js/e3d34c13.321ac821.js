This data was obtained through seemingly harmless surveys and quizzes that users participated in, often unaware of the extensive data collection happening behind the scenes. Cambridge Analytica utilized this information to build psychological profiles, which were later used to influence political campaigns, particularly the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit referendum (Confessore, 2018). This event highlighted the manipulation and unethical use of survey data, where innocent engagement on social platforms was exploited for political and financial gains.\nIn a similar vein, a study published in 2022 revealed that medical apps have been sharing sensitive health data with third-party platforms like Facebook for advertising purposes. Many health apps, including those focused on pregnancy, fitness, or cancer patient support, collect data through the app or connected wearable devices. Users might consent to share their data by agreeing to the app\u2019s terms and conditions. However, there is growing concern over the unethical use of Meta Pixel JavaScript on hospital websites, where patients\u2019 health data was collected and shared without their knowledge or consent. This data was used by advertisers to target vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients, with personalized ads based on their browsing habits. Legal action has already been taken against healthcare providers who violated HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations (Alder, 2022).\n\u2003"}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(a.h4,{id:"ethical-social-legal-and-professional-impacts",children:"Ethical, Social, Legal, and Professional Impacts"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(a.p,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.strong,{children:"Ethical Impact"}),"\nThe primary ethical concern in both cases is the breach of trust.
