The core idea was to use a leader-election pattern to scan a given folder input, identify security and key files, and quarantine them (Microsoft, 2024). The system architecture featured a leader agent responsible for monitoring and managing multiple worker agents, which ensures resilience and fault tolerance.

Among descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive models used as prognostic models (Diez-Olivan et al., 2019), the predictive models are likely to play an outsized role in realizing the vision of industry 4.0; this is because of the sheer volume of data coming from both inside and outside of the equipment or factory in question. Consider the example of keeping a factory fully operational when there are adverse weather conditions such as what we have experienced in California lately. A predictive model would have the capability to detect and make predictions based on upstream datapoints. And by doing that help prevent interruptions even before they occur. These models provide the opportunity for proactive interventions rather than reactive remediations; this means a factory would be able to predict power outages, identify the possible points of failures during an outage and ensure there is sufficient back-up capacity to operate without interruptions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ml-docs/unit-2/Reflection":{"id":"ml-docs/unit-2/Reflection","title":"Reflection","description":"The exploratory data analysis unit provided the opportunity to refresh my knowledge and get the exposure to a new EDA workflow.
