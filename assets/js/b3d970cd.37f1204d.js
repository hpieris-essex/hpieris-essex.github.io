Administrative functions such as producing form letters could be done much more efficiently with a great reduction in costs by using an AI writer. Technical writing such as producing manuals could similarly benefit from AI writers, especially when used in conjunction with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to perform the required information lookups through the appropriate knowledgebases (Lewis et al., 2020). Creative writers could use AI writers to overcome writer\u2019s block and re-use sentence and content structures that are proven to work."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Despite all these benefits, there are risks. Imagine an instance where AI writers are used to summarize college applications. While it may be a good use of the technology to use AI writers to summarize applications for quick review, it is likely to produce harmful outcomes if the AI writers are also asked to filter which applications are better than the others. These AI writers may replicate some of the racial and societal biases present in the training dataset (Bender et al., 2021)."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Another risk is intellectual property theft or intellectual property misuse through derivative works created by AI.
