### Overview

Area under the ROC curve and R<sup>2</sup> are measures used for evaluating model performance.

- AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) measures the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes. Higher values indicate better classification performance.

- R<sup>2</sup> error, quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Values closer to 1 indicate better model fit.

In this task, I experimented with different parameters to how they imapct the model performance, which is reflected in changing values for AUC and R<sup>2</sup>.

For example, changing the y_pred data to match y_true results in an R<sup>2</sup> value of 1.
