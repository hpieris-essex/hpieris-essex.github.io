In this final unit of the machine learning module — Industry 4.0 and Machine Learning, we covered the smartisation of manufacturing industries through the use of machine learning. It was interesting to explore robotics use cases in manufacturing and how machine learning would be instrumental in producing high levels of efficiency and cost reduction in industry 4.0.

Throughout the module I enjoyed the opportunity to re-visit and re-enforce my understanding of machine learning fundamentals. I was wable to identify repeatable frameworks and processes that I could use in my machine learning projects from the provided examples and coursework. I also noticed the emphasis on visiting social and ethical issues associated with machine learning throughout the module. As a result, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of considering the social and ethical issues associated with machine learning initiatives not as an afterthought but rather as a pillar of the initiative itself. 

I look forward to leveraging the learnings from this module to deliver high-quality machine learning implementations more efficiently while being mindful of the social and ethical issues that may arise from my work.
