The introduction to ANNs unit provided an overview of how biological neurons function, and how this understanding is modeled in artificial neural networks through weights, biases and layers (Yang et al., 2014). I enjoyed re-visiting the implementations of a simple perceptron, perceptron with an operator and a multi-layer perceptron. The background in biology provided through this unit is quite insightful and expanded my understanding of the ANNs.
