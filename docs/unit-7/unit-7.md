#  Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

A perceptron is a single-layer neural network and the simplest form of an artificial neural network (ANN). It computes a weighted sum of its input features and applies a threshold function to determine the output.

An activation function in a perceptron acts as an operator that decides whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the weighted sum of the inputs.

A Multilayer Perceptron consists of multiple layers of perceptrons, including input, hidden, and output layers, enabling it to model complex nonlinear relationships through backpropagation.
