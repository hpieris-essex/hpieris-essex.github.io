# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Read the Wall (2019) article and record your thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.

Run this CNN model - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Object Recognition.ipynb - and review different sections of the algorithm. Change the input image for prediction by changing the value of this variable - plt.imshow(x_test[16] - from 16 to value of your choice (1-15) and see whether the model predicts correctly.
