The case study of Abi, a researcher and statistical programmer, focuses on the ethical dilemma of presenting findings about a new cereal, Whizzz. Abi’s data indicates that Whizzz may be harmful, contradicting the manufacturer’s claim that it is nutritious. Abi considers performing additional analyses that could show Whizzz in a more favorable light. While manipulating data values would be clearly unethical, Abi’s contemplation of selectively presenting analyses also raises significant ethical concerns.

The BCS Code of Conduct emphasizes the importance of professional competence and integrity, requiring members to avoid any action that misrepresents information or harms others. Section 3.e of the BCS Code specifically prohibits withholding or misrepresenting data about products and systems (BCS 2022). Abi must report his findings transparently, including both the positive and negative results. By presenting only favorable results, he would violate the principle of honesty and integrity, potentially misleading the manufacturer and, by extension, the public.

Ethical standards in research emphasize transparency and objectivity as central to maintaining integrity. Selectively reporting favorable results while ignoring negative findings, known as "cherry-picking," undermines the trustworthiness of scientific research (Institute of Data, 2023). In this case, Abi risks contributing to a bias known as selective reporting, which can distort the interpretation of data and cause harm if the product is marketed without consideration of the negative findings (Cleophas & Cleophas, 1999).
Abi is also obligated to act in the public interest, as outlined in Section 1 of the BCS Code. This includes ensuring that the public’s health and well-being are not compromised by the selective use of data (BCS, 2022). If the manufacturer uses only the positive results to market a potentially harmful product, the legal and social implications could be severe. Ethically, Abi should present all the data clearly and include a disclaimer about the limitations of the analysis to protect public interest.

This case demonstrates the legal, social, and professional responsibilities Abi must uphold. Transparency and objectivity are essential to maintaining the integrity of his work and avoiding potential harm to consumers.
