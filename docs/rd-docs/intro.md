# Research Methods & Professional Practice Module Reflection
 
The Research Methods and Professional Practice module took us through research methodologies, ethics, and statistical techniques, all of which are highly relevant to my work in AI. I was already familiar with some of the concepts we discussed during this module. However, the depth and clarity of the content allowed me to refine my understanding and apply these principles in more meaningful ways to both current and future projects.

I found it quite useful to revisit and review the concepts of inductive and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning is fundamental to many areas of AI, particularly in machine learning, where models generalize from data. Deductive reasoning also plays a role, especially in logic-based systems and formal rule-based approaches. The framework presented in this module helped me see where I could apply them more effectively. For example, inductive reasoning plays a key role when analyzing patterns in data and drawing conclusions that generalize beyond the dataset. In contrast, deductive reasoning helps validate these conclusions in specific cases (Bradford et al., 2024).

Discussion of ethics is critical in the context of AI-related research. I found the framework of focusing on the key principles of respect, beneficence, justice, and respect for law and public interest to be simple, easy to follow, and yet highly effective (Finn & Shilton, 2023). My current work focuses on building autonomous AI agents to take over mission-critical workloads in large businesses — the principle of beneficence resonated with me in this context. Unlike medical research, the risk to the participants may not be direct and apparent in AI-related research. Therefore, I think we need to be extra careful to avoid risk and harm to the participants and society in general. 

In unit two, we studied the process of developing a strong research question and crafting a corresponding proposal. I frequently read AI research papers and can usually identify the central research question. However, this module helped me better understand how these questions are formulated in the first place. The process of transforming a broad research idea into a focused, specific question requires precision. This has enhanced my appreciation of academic papers and influenced how I approach my own work, making me more focused on the specific problems I am addressing rather than getting lost in broad explorations.

The module's focus on different research methodologies was another area of growth. My work in AI typically relies on quantitative methods due to the nature of the field, particularly when dealing with large datasets or model performance metrics. However, gaining an understanding of qualitative research methods has broadened my perspective. While I will likely continue to lean on quantitative approaches in my work, the exposure to qualitative methodologies, such as case studies and interviews, has given me a more holistic view of research. This is particularly useful when evaluating interdisciplinary research where quantitative and qualitative methods may intersect, such as in human-AI interaction studies.

One of the most practical lessons from the module was the critique of data collection methods.  I selected the California Teachers Study questionnaire for critique as one of my e-portfolio activities for this unit. I was somewhat surprised to see the flaws in this questionnaire when evaluating using the frameworks provided in this course. I was able to identify flaws such as double-barreled questions and ambiguity, which may have compromised the data collection in this widely circulated questionnaire. I’m confident that I’ll be able to come up with high-quality questionnaires in my research work where appropriate due to the fundamentals provided in this module. 

The statistical methods covered in this module provided an opportunity to reinforce concepts I have previously studied for machine learning. Descriptive and inferential statistics form the backbone of machine learning. Hypothesis testing and statistical significance are critical for validating model performance and ensuring that improvements are not due to random chance (Brownlee, 2019). The exercises in this module were a helpful refresher, reminding me of the importance of returning to foundational concepts to ensure accuracy and validity in results. While I often use tools like Jupyter Notebook with Python and Pandas, the practical exercises in Excel demonstrated that even simple tools can be powerful for quick statistical analysis.

AI research often involves translating complex, technical findings into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders, and being able to present data effectively is critical for ensuring that these insights are understood and implemented. Presenting complex data clearly is an essential part of my job. For this reason, I found the emphasis on data visualization particularly relevant.

The unit on project management and risk was directly applicable to my work as well. AI projects, particularly those involving emerging technologies like large language models, are inherently high-risk. The rapid pace of change in this field means that projects are often subject to shifting technologies, data availability, and even regulatory changes. A risk management process that includes risk identification, assessment and analysis, mitigation/ fallback planning, and ongoing risk management, as I read as part of this module, would help mitigate these risks and increase the probability of success (PMIS, 2021). 

In conclusion, this module has been a valuable experience, both in reinforcing my existing knowledge and in introducing me to new concepts that are directly applicable to my work. The structured approach to research methodologies, ethics, statistical analysis, and project management has given me practical tools that I can immediately apply to AI research and development. Going forward, the skills and frameworks I’ve gained here will help me produce more rigorous, ethical, and impactful work, ensuring that my contributions to AI research are both technically sound and socially responsible.
