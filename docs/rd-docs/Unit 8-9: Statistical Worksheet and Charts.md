## Charts Worksheet

### Exercise 9.1

**Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies alongside that for Area 1.Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?**

The percentage frequency bar chart reveals notable differences in brand preferences between Area 1 and Area 2. In Area 2, Out of the two brands of interest, Brand B is the most preferred, with 33.3% of respondents favoring it, compared to 24.3% in Area 1. This indicates a stronger preference for Brand B in Area 2. Brand A also has a higher preference in Area 2, at 21.1%, compared to 15.7% in Area 1. Conversely, the "Other" category has a significantly higher percentage in Area 1 (60.0%) than in Area 2 (45.6%), suggesting that respondents in Area 1 tend to prefer brands outside of A and B more than those in Area 2.

These results suggest that Area 2 shows a stronger loyalty to established brands (A and B), while Area 1 has a broader distribution of preferences, with a greater inclination towards alternative brands.


### Exercise 9.2

**Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.2E.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the frequency distributions for Data Set E (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart showing the heather species prevalence in the two different locations. Briefly interpret your findings.**

The data includes frequencies for two different locations (A and B), categorized into "Absent," "Sparse," and "Abundant" for a specific measure.

Location A has more cases of "Abundant" (26 occurrences) compared to "Sparse" (22 occurrences) and "Absent" (8 occurrences). This suggests a higher overall presence in Location A. Location B shows a higher frequency of "Absent" cases (20 occurrences) compared to "Sparse" (14 occurrences) and "Abundant" (10 occurrences). This indicates a generally lower presence in Location B. Overall, Location A tends to show greater abundance, while Location B exhibits more absence, suggesting a significant difference in the distribution of prevalence of heather between the two locations.


### Exercise 9.3

**Open the Excel workbook in Exa 9.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 9.3 together with some of the Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above example. Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for each of the two diets**

Diet A:
The distribution of weight loss is relatively spread, with the highest relative frequencies at class marks 5 and 7 (both 30%).
There are smaller peaks at class marks 3 (20%) and 1 (6%), while the extremes (-1 and 11) show minimal representation (both 2%).
This suggests that the weight loss results for Diet A are clustered around the middle values, with a few outliers at the lower and higher ends.

Diet B:
For Diet B, the peak frequency occurs at class mark 3 (30%), followed by class marks 5 (22%) and 1 (20%).
The distribution also shows lower frequencies at the extremes, with class marks -1 (6%), 9 (4%), and 11 (2%).
Overall, both diets show a concentration of frequencies in the middle ranges, with Diet A exhibiting a more balanced spread across class marks 5 and 7, while Diet Bâ€™s data is more concentrated around class mark 3, indicating stronger clustering in the mid-range for Diet B.
