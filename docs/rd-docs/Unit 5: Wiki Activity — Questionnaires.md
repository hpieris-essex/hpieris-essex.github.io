The California Teachers Study 2017-2019 questionnaire is designed to collect a range of health, lifestyle, and demographic data from participants. While comprehensive, there are areas where both the format and content of the questionnaire could be improved for clarity, inclusiveness, and engagement (California Teachers Study, 2019).


1. Length and Engagement:
    - Critique: The questionnaire is long and could lead to survey fatigue. Lengthy surveys, especially with complex health questions, may result in incomplete responses or errors due to lack of attention.

    - Improvement: Group questions into sections with clear headings, providing a progress bar or clear indication of how far the respondent is into the questionnaire. Additionally, offering optional short breaks (for long questionnaires) may help maintain attention.

2.	Demographic Questions:
    - Critique: The questionnaire asks for personal information such as income, marital status, and gender identity. Some of these questions may feel intrusive or uncomfortable, particularly for sensitive topics like income or sexual orientation.

    - Improvement: Include explanations of why certain demographic data are being collected and how the information will be used. This builds trust and may increase the likelihood of accurate answers.

3.	Health Questions (e.g., sleep, exercise, family history):
    - Critique: Many health-related questions (e.g., sleep problems, exercise frequency) rely on the respondent’s memory, which can lead to recall bias. For example, asking about exercise habits over the past three years may result in inaccurate estimates.

    - Improvement: Shorten the recall period to a more recent timeframe (e.g., the past 6 months) to improve accuracy. In addition, provide examples or scales that help clarify what is considered "moderate" or "strenuous" activity.

4.	Question Clarity and Structure:
    - Critique: Some questions, especially regarding medication use and health conditions, are phrased in a way that assumes the respondent has sufficient medical knowledge. The layout of these questions can be overwhelming, as they ask for multiple responses in a single list.

    - Improvement: Break down complex questions (e.g., “Have you taken medication for this condition?” and “Are you currently taking medication for this condition?”) into smaller, more manageable chunks. Include brief definitions or explanations for medical terms, or provide examples to ensure respondents understand what is being asked.

5.	Response Options:
    - Critique: The response scales for questions (e.g., "Very satisfied" to "Very dissatisfied") are appropriate for measuring subjective feelings, but some options are redundant or too vague (e.g., "Somewhat" versus "A little").

    - Improvement: Use balanced response options (e.g., clearly distinguish between "mild" and "moderate"). Avoid vague terms like "Don't know" where possible and instead offer "Not applicable" or "Prefer not to answer."

6.	Questions about Sensitive Topics:
    - Critique: The questions about family medical history, income, sexual orientation, and cannabis use are very personal and may lead to discomfort or reluctance in answering. These topics can be perceived as invasive if not handled with care.

    - Improvement: Add disclaimers explaining the importance of these questions for the study’s goals. Offer respondents the option to skip questions or select “Prefer not to answer” more visibly to make them feel more comfortable participating.
