## Hypothesis Testing Worksheet

### Exercise 7.1

**Recall that in the previous unit exercises, a two-tailed test was undertaken whether the population mean impurity differed between the two filtration agents in Data Set G. 
Suppose instead a one-tailed test had been conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was the more effective. What would your conclusions have been?**

[Link to The Excel Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wYD61zSzNuBS4ZdtMG1ywbyyPP3oHMdw/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=104509639658132351822&rtpof=true&sd=true)

The two-tailed test to determine if there was any significant difference in the mean impurity levels between the two filtration agents, Agent 1 and Agent 2 shows that there is a statistically significant difference. Based on the negative t-statistic (-3.26), Agent 1 shows a lower mean impurity level than Agent 2. While a two-tailed test confirms that there is a significant difference, it tests for differences in both directions (i.e., greater or smaller) and is not focused solely on whether one agent is more effective than the other.

In this exercise, we are considering a one-tailed test to determine whether Filter Agent 1 is more effective (i.e., whether it leaves fewer impurities than Filter Agent 2), our hypotheses are as follows:

•	Null Hypothesis (H₀): Filter Agent 1 is not more effective than Filter Agent 2 (i.e., the mean impurity level for Agent 1 is greater than or equal to that of Agent 2).
•	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Filter Agent 2 (i.e., the mean impurity level for Agent 1 is less than that of Agent 2).
From the paired t-test results:
•	The t-statistic is -3.26.
•	The p-value for the one-tailed test is 0.00377.
Since the p-value of 0.00377 is less than the typical significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is statistically significant evidence to support the claim that Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Filter Agent 2 in terms of reducing impurities.

If a one-tailed test had been conducted with the hypothesis that Agent 1 was more effective, the conclusion would be that Agent 1 is in fact more effective than Agent 2 at reducing impurities, based on the data from the 12 batches.


### Excercise 7.2

**Consider the bank cardholder data of Data Set C. Open the Excel workbook Exa8.6C.xlsx which contains this data from the Exercises folder.
Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete an appropriate test of whether the 
population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret your findings. What assumptions underpin the validity of your analysis, and how could you validate them**

To determine whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females, I performed a one-tailed test assuming equal variances between the two groups. This test helps assess whether males, on average, earn more than females.

The hypotheses for this test are as follows:

•	Null Hypothesis (H₀): The mean income for males is less than or equal to that of females.
•	Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): The mean income for males is greater than that of females.
From the t-test results:
•	The t-statistic is 3.27.
•	The p-value for the one-tailed test is 0.00071.

Since the p-value of 0.00071 is below the significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is statistically significant evidence to support the claim that the mean income for males exceeds that of females.

In summary, the analysis indicates that males have a significantly higher mean income than females, based on the data provided.


## Summary Measures Worksheet

### Excercise 6.1

**Open the Excel workbook Exa 8.1B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the sample size, sample mean weight loss and the sample standard deviation of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F23 to F25, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the 
above example.Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets**

[Link to The Excel Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cSz154ez9MAxEXm1QoftIl9DukyI_mwb/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=104509639658132351822&rtpof=true&sd=true)

The results from the two weight loss diets indicate that, on average, participants in Diet A lost 5.341 kg, while participants in Diet B lost 3.710 kg. The standard deviations (SD) of weight loss are 2.536 for Diet A and 2.769 for Diet B, suggesting similar levels of variability in individual results for both diets. These results suggest that Diet A was more effective in reducing weight compared to Diet B, as the mean weight loss for Diet A is higher. 


### Excercise 6.2

**Open the Excel workbook Exa 8.2B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the sample median, first and third quartiles and the sample interquartile range of the weight loss for Diet B. Place these results in the block of cells F26 to F29, using the same format as that employed for the Diet A results in the 
above example.Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets**

[Link to The Excel Worksheet]()

For Diet A, participants experienced an average weight loss of 5.341 kg, with a median of 5.642 kg. In comparison, participants on Diet B had an average weight loss of 3.710 kg, with a median of 3.745 kg. This suggests that Diet A was more effective in reducing weight, as it had both a higher mean and median weight loss.

In terms of variability, Diet A had a standard deviation of 2.536 kg and an interquartile range (IQR) of 3.285 kg, while Diet B had a slightly higher standard deviation of 2.769 kg and an IQR of 3.451 kg. This indicates that both diets had similar levels of variation in individual results, with participants responding differently to each diet.

In summary, Diet A appears to be more effective in promoting weight loss compared to Diet B, based on the higher average and median weight loss. However, the variability in results was similar for both diets, meaning individual responses varied in a comparable way across the two groups.



### Excercise 6.3

**Open the Excel workbook Exa 8.3D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. Obtain the frequencies and percentage frequencies of the variable Brand, but this time for the Area 2 respondents, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example.Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas**

[Link to The Excel Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lhT3VMzVm8gtYjb8FrI68URmUVIslMT3/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=104509639658132351822&rtpof=true&sd=true)


The analysis suggests that Brand B is the preferred brand in both areas, but the preference for the two brands is stronger in Area 2, where a higher percentage of individuals choose Brand B. In contrast, Area 1 shows a higher preference for other brands, suggesting that market penetration or brand loyalty for these two brands may be weaker in this demographic area.
