In this group project, we performed the following tasks using the provided AirBnB dataset (AB_NYC_2019.csv):

- Identify an interesting business analytic question that can be answered using the given Airbnb dataset
- Peform data analysis that includes: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data pre-processing, statistics-based data analysis, data visualisation and use of unsupervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering)
- Produce an analytical report

### Individual Contributions

My individual contributions to the project include the following:

- Coming up with the business question
- Producing the first version of the data analysis that included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data pre-processing, statistics-based data analysis, data visualisation (charts and heatmaps) and use of clustering to identify grouping of properties
- Wrote the introduction and conclusion paragraphs
- Proofread the final version and made edits for brevity
