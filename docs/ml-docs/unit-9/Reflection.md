The introduction to convolutional neural networks unit covered the algorithm and model architecture for building a CNN. My work in machine learning thus far has been focused on tabular and text data. I enjoyed the opportunity to dive into computer vision through this unit. The video content on concepts such as convolution operation, filters and pooling provided a strong foundational understanding of the building blocks of a CNN. I look forward to exploring more computer vision use cases with my newfound knowledge of convolutional neural networks.
