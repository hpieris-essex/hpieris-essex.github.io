title: Discussion — Risks and benefits of the use AI writers [Summary Post]
---

I often use Chat GPT as a writing partner. I ask Chat GPT to expand upon an outline and write a draft. Each time, I find myself throwing away everything ChatGPT produces and starting new. The language is often superfluous, too flowery one might say. However, this process of going back and forth gets me writing faster, clearer, and more often. It has proven to be a great way to overcome writer’s block. Personally, for me, this has been a great benefit — especially when I’m context-switching from coding to writing.


Automatic language generation offers benefits in many types of writing — from administrative work to creative copy. Administrative functions such as producing form letters could be done much more efficiently with a great reduction in costs by using an AI writer. Technical writing such as producing manuals could similarly benefit from AI writers, especially when used in conjunction with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to perform the required information lookups through the appropriate knowledgebases (Lewis et al., 2020). Creative writers could use AI writers to overcome writer’s block and re-use sentence and content structures that are proven to work.


Despite all these benefits, there are risks. Imagine an instance where AI writers are used to summarize college applications. While it may be a good use of the technology to use AI writers to summarize applications for quick review, it is likely to produce harmful outcomes if the AI writers are also asked to filter which applications are better than the others. These AI writers may replicate some of the racial and societal biases present in the training dataset (Bender et al., 2021).


Another risk is intellectual property theft or intellectual property misuse through derivative works created by AI. AI writers can perform tone and style adjustments of a given content input. It is conceivable that these types of capabilities can be used to produce derivative work without proper authorization or licensing from the original authors. New laws are being introduced focused on the safety of AI systems such as the EU’s AI Act (Gibney, 2024). However, we need to do more to protect content ownership and commercial interests in the context of AI. 

In summary, AI writers open a world of possibilities. While there are risks associated with the use of these writers, I’m optimistic that they will do more good than bad with some careful thought and planning around how we introduce these AI writers to society.
