In October 2023, California suspended the autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permit it had issued to GMâ€™s Cruise division, citing risks to public safety (Jin & Shepardson, 2023). AI-powered autonomous driving could be considered a catalyst for operational efficiency in Industry 4.0. This event represents a considerable blow to the advancement of this segment.

One of the top labor shortage areas is commercial driving. In the United States, the shortage of truck drivers is expected to grow from 60,800 in 2018 to 160,000 in 2028 (Costello & Karickhoff, 2019). This shortage is quite concerning, considering that in the US, 69% of domestic freight tonnage is moved by the commercial trucking industry (Torrey & Murray, 2015). AI-powered autonomous driving systems offer the promise of overcoming these shortages and supporting the flow of goods and the growth of the economy.

While companies and governments are excited to embrace technology and usher in the era of Industry 4.0, the fate of autonomous vehicles in San Francisco is a cautionary tale of why we should proceed carefully. Erosion of public trust and decline in investments due to extra regulatory scrutiny could delay industry progress by many years. Companies and governments should take careful measures to develop peripheral infrastructure to support safety and accountability around advanced automation.
