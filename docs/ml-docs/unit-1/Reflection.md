I’ve been working in the field of machine learning and AI since 2015. However, most of my learning in this field comes from sources such Udacity, Coursera, and other online resources. Through this module my objective was to re-visit some of the foundational elements of machine learning, strengthen my understanding of those concepts and validate my learnings. The first unit, and as it seems all the units in the module seems to have an emphasis on visiting social and ethical issues associated with machine learning. 

Through the discussion in the first unit, I’ve come to appreciate the importance of considering the social and ethical issues associated with machine learning initiative not as an afterthought but rather as a pillar of the initiative itself.

I look forward to incorporating discussions about social and ethical issues of machine learning into all my future machine learning implementation projects.
