The exploratory data analysis unit provided the opportunity to refresh my knowledge and get the exposure to a new EDA workflow. I appreciated the Housing Prices Exploratory Data analysis Jupyter Notebook Liz Coulter-Smith had put together for the unit (Coulter-Smith, 2023); it provides a repeatable workflow that one can use in any exploratory data analysis project. I also appreciated the strong emphasis on why not to shortcut the EDA process. Due to time pressures around projects, Iâ€™ve had instances where we moved forward with shallow EDA, only regret it later.
