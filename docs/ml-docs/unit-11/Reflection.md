The model selection and evaluation provides a comprehensive overview of approaches for arriving at a high-performing model, and the type of challenges we would encounter in the process. I have working knowledge of model selection and evaluation through my machine learning work in the past. However, reviewing this information was useful to expand my understanding of the topic. I look forward to converting the learning from this unit into a repeatable process that I could apply for model selection and evaluation in my projects in the future.
