Clustering with Python unit is when our first group project was due. For the group project, I came up with the business question, produced the first version of the data analysis that included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data pre-processing, statistics-based data analysis, data visualisation (charts and heatmaps) and use of clustering to identify grouping of properties, and wrote the introduction and conclusion sections of the report. The other team members iterated on the EDA. I was glad to see another team member introducing the elbow method to validate the number of clusters. We had a last minute communications breakdown. But, we were able to recover quickly and submit the project in time. I think overall we worked well as a team. Some of the communications challenges made me appreciate the cultural and background differences among team members in a distributed setting and the importance of leaving room for the team members to both work jointly and separately to advance the project.
