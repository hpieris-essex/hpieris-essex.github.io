Corelation and regression unit provided me with another opportunity to revisit the fundamentals. We visited topics such as Pearson correlation, linear regression and polynomial regression in this unit. I have used linear regression in the early days of my machine learning career. It was enjoyable to revisit these topics. This is another area where I saw an opportunity to create project checklists and workflows based on the learnings. For example, I imagine having a repeatable decision tree where we ask questions like what is the objective (predict vs measure strength/ direction of a relationship), are both variables on an equal standing, is causation a consideration. And based on the answers having a clear prescriptive checklist we can follow from there. Iâ€™m excited to use this learning to optimize my project workflows in the future.
