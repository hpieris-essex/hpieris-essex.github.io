During the clustering unit we explored, how the unsupervised learning approach of clustering is used to identify various groups within data. A vast amount of unlabeled data is readily available (Nigam et al., 2000); these could only be used in unsupervised implementations unless someone goes through the effort of labeling. For this reason, unsupervised learning algorithms are an important tool in the machine learning toolbox. This unit provided a foundational understanding of K-means clustering, a popular unsupervised clustering technique. I’m excited to apply these clustering techniques with everyday data such as systems logs and telemetry data to discover patterns.
