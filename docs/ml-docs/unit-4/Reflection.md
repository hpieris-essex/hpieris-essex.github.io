Linear regression with Scikit-Learn provided the opportunity to re-vist this popular library and freshen-up my understanding. I have used Scikit-Learn library often in the past. However, recently my focus has been on transformer-based models â€” a type of deep learning models that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data (Vaswani et al., 2017). Coming back to Scikit-Learn and reviewing fundamentals such as Linear Regression helped me fully appreciate the importance of these building blocks in more advanced machine learning models.
