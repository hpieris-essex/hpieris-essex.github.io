### Unit Reflection: Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This week, we focused on the theories and concepts underpinning NLP, with practical demonstrations and activities to enhance our understanding.

#### Key Learnings

1. **Word2Vec in Action**: Investigating Word2Vec through a Python example was illuminating. This hands-on experience clarified how word embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, showcasing the practical applications of this model in NLP tasks.

2. **Parse Tree Structures**: The formative activity on constituency-based parse trees was particularly useful. Creating and analyzing parse trees helped reinforce how syntactic structures are parsed and understood by NLP systems, deepening my comprehension of language processing.

#### Application and Reflection

By the end of this unit, I can explain the key elements of NLP models and engage with common NLP methods through worked examples. Additionally, I am now proficient in developing parse trees, which support a deeper understanding of NLP. This unit has significantly enhanced my ability to apply theoretical NLP concepts in practical scenarios, crucial for advancing my skills in intelligent agent design.
