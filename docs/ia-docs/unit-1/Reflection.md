### Unit Reflection: Introduction to Agent-Based Computing

This week, we focused on the trends in computing that have led to the rise of agent-based computing and introduced the concept of an agent.

#### Key Learnings

1. **Growth of Agent-Based Technologies**: Understanding the trends driving the growth of agent-based technologies highlighted why these approaches have become popular across various sectors. Key factors include advancements in AI and the increasing need for autonomous systems.

2. **Autonomy in Computing**: Discussing what it means for a computer program to be autonomous clarified its relevance in today's technological landscape. Autonomous agents can make decisions and act independently, making them invaluable for complex, dynamic environments.

3. **Agent Interactions and Applications**: Exploring how agents interact with their environment and each other provided insights into their versatility. We examined examples of agent-based systems and their applications, from robotics to financial modeling.

#### Application and Reflection

By the end of this unit, I have developed an understanding of the key concepts of agent-based computing and the trends that have facilitated its development. I can compare different types of agent-based systems to assess their relative merits. This knowledge lays a solid foundation for further exploration into the field of intelligent agents.
