We live in an increasingly complex world where systems are modularized, changeable, and non-conforming to rigid structures; consider the supply chain modularization in the French car industry for example (Doran et al., 2007). Agent-based systems are suitable for modeling and operating in complex systems and environments (Parunak, 1998). In this context, agent-based systems are growing in popularity.


Agents can be described through four characteristics: entity, environment, parameters, and action. Entity refers to the form factor — an agent could be software, hardware, or a combination of both. The environment refers to where an agent is placed, which could be physical or virtual. Parameters are inputs that the agent receives from its environment. And, actions refer to an agent's behavior that results in a change in its environment (Dorri et al., 2018).


Agent-based systems offer many benefits to organizations. These include enhanced problem-solving capabilities, scalability and robustness, and real-time adaptation and learning. 


Enhanced problem-solving capabilities: Agent-based systems can sense and respond to their environment and act autonomously to reach the given goal individually or working together with other agents (Jennings, 1994). This gives them superior problem-solving capabilities compared to a system that merely executes a sequence of actions regardless of the environmental conditions. 


Scalability and robustness: In multi-agent systems where agents act individually or collectively to reach a given goal. They could be designed in such a way that a failure in a single agent does not result in a complete system failure (Baldoni et al., 2020); this makes agent-based systems more robust. The ability to introduce more agents to an environment improves the scalability of a system.


Real-time adaptation and learning: Artificial intelligence offers a path for agents to learn their environment and adapt to optimally accomplish the given goal (Lattner et al., 2011). This is a key benefit for any system that is deployed in an environment that is subjected to constant change. For example, imagine a content moderation agent in a social network. The ability to learn and adapt in real-time would mean that the system is both effective at its job and cost-efficient to operate.


In conclusion, agent-based systems offer a path to building effective, efficient, and robust systems that can keep up with the increasing complexities of organizational operations.
