In the CNN interactive learning unit we further explored convolutional neural networks. It was interesting to see the visual modelling of how neural networks work. I have briefly looked at visualization tools like Tensorboard in the past (Ganegedara, 2018). However, I hadnâ€™t fully explored them before. I found it useful to get some re-exposure to various visualization tools. I see them as valuable tools for communicating model architectures and complexities with various stakeholders in the future.
